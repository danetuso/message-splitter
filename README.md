# Message Splitter

## Overview
Message Splitter is a simple, user-friendly web application designed to split large text into smaller parts based on a specified character limit. It's particularly useful for situations where message size is restricted, such as SMS messages, Tweets, or any other platform with a character limit.

## Features
- **Message Input**: A large, resizable area to paste the text you want to split.
- **Character Limit Input**: An input field to specify the maximum number of characters for each split segment.
- **Intelligent Splitting**: The application splits text at space characters to avoid breaking words, ensuring readability.
- **Numbered Output**: Each split text segment is numbered for easy tracking.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: A 'Copy' button next to each segment for quickly copying text to the clipboard, with visual feedback when text is copied.

## How to Use
1. Paste the message you want to split into the text input area.
2. Enter the maximum number of characters allowed per text segment.
3. Press the "Split Text" button to split the text.
4. Click the "Copy" button next to a segment to copy it to the clipboard.

## Customization
You can easily customize the look and feel of the application by modifying the `style.css` file. The application uses plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it straightforward to tweak to your liking.
